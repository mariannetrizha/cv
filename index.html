				<h1>Hi there!&#x1F44B;</h1>
				<div id="links">

				<p>
				
					I'm Mars. For the past 5 years, I've lead teams, projects and products from scratch. Currently, I'm developing a new line of business for <a href="https://www.getmagicnow.com">Magic</a> (Y Combinator, W15), alongside the former head of Product at Tumblr and Udemy</a>. I thrive in teams where there are mentor figures. When I'm managing a group, I enable people to make sound decisions fast; when leading a project, I focus a lot on shipping. I'm gritty, data driven, intuitive and intentional. People like to tap me when they need to innovate or create a structure out of chaos.  
				</p>

				<p>
					Outside my full time job, I invest my time learning new skills and running a few side hustles. For example, this 2020, I sold 30 houses and <a href="">got published  </a>at 6 tech publications. 

					I tend to push my limits - such as when I went to a 6 month coding bootcamp while managing 50 people at work, or when I ran a marketing campaign and had to respond to 100 warm leads a day on my personal Facebook (I later built a bot to handle this). This is all by design - I approached my early 20s with a heart for heavy hustling, experimenting and failing fast, all in the name of self improvement and self discovery. 

				</p>

				<p>
				 Now in my mid-20s, I can say I've worn enough hats and scratched a lot of surfaces that I have a good idea where I want to be in the next 5 years. I want to build a career in tech, particularly in the field of data science. And I want to take it easy. More careful selection of work, more focus on projects that impact people's lives, more methodical learning, more bandwidth for creativity and ultimately, more time for holistic growth.
